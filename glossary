1.  \command: this is a control sequence which performs an action, such as \newpage. Always begins with a backslash (\) and is in lowercase letters. A command always needs to be followed by white space. 
2.  environment: a block of code with specific behavior depending on its type. Environments are used to format blocks of text and usually require \begin{}....\end{} to create the environment. For example: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
\item
\item
\end{itemize}
(all items will appear in a bulleted list)
3.  package: a LaTeX package (most likely already installed in your editor) - packages enable you to do more, like create bibliographies, insert images, and write formulas and figures. 
4.  CTAN: the comprehensive TeX archive network where you can go to install and download all this LaTeX
5.  Markup: the term for printing, or how to lay the document out, or instructions or descriptions added to the document as guidelines for identification or formatting. 
6.  argument: information to be acted upon (follows a command in the form of curly braces{}). For example, \begin{itemize} tells LaTeX that you want to begin a list of items.  
7. Class: the type of document that controls the overall appearance and layout of the document (e.g. CV, article, book, report, poster, etc.)
8. preamble: the "brain" of the document - the premable is all of the text that sits above the command: \begin{document}. Content in the preamble defines how the document will look, how the document will be structured, and other features, like whether or not there will be a table of contents or a bibliography.
